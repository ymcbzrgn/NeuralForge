## ✨ Features

### 🧠 **Intelligent Multi-Model System**
```python
# Three specialized models working in parallel
models = {
    "CodeT5+": "Fast completions",      # 770M params
    "StableCode": "16K context",        # 3B params  
    "StarCoder": "Complex generation"   # 15B params
}
# Automatic routing to best model for the task
```

### 📈 **Continuous Learning**
- Learns from every accepted/rejected completion
- Adapts to your coding style in ~100 interactions
- Project-specific pattern recognition
- Git history analysis for context

### 🎯 **Project DNA**
Every project gets a unique AI model that:
- Understands your codebase architecture
- Follows your naming conventions
- Maintains consistency across files
- Learns from your commit history

### 🔄 **Adapter Marketplace**
```bash
# Download specialized adapters
neuralforge pull adapter facebook/react-hooks

## 🎯 Philosophy

> "AI should amplify human creativity, not exploit it. Your code is your intellectual property. Your patterns are your expertise. Your privacy is non-negotiable."

NeuralForge is built on three principles:
1. **Privacy First** - Your code never leaves your machine
2. **Community Driven** - Built by developers, for developers  
3. **Continuous Learning** - Gets better with every line you write
